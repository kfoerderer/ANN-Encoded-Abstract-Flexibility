# ANN-Encoded-Abstract-Flexibility

Here, in this repository, you find the data and neural models tested in the paper: [*Modeling flexibility using artificial neural networks*, 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42162-018-0024-4)

**Please note that you need [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to download the dataset during cloning.**

## How to run the experiments

1. Unzip the dataset
```
$ cd data/generated_dataset; unzip dataset.zip; cd ../..
```

2. Create a Python 3 VirtualEnv and install the dependencies
**Please note that the software versions of the dependencies may be outdated since the requirements match the exact versions we used during our experiments.**
```
$ virtualenv --python=python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Convert the dataset
```
(venv) $ cd data; ./run.sh; cd ..
```

4. Run the experiments
```
(venv) $ cd neuralnets; bash ./run_batch.sh ; cd ..
```

5. Create a summary of the experiment results. The results should look similar to [Experiment Results.txt](Experiment Results.txt).
```
(venv) $ cd data/experiments; python all_summery.py
```
